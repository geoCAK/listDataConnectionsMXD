# listDataConnectionsMXD
Python script(s) for listing data connections of layers in an ArcGIS MXD.

This will likely turn into a collection of scripts that are to be used with ArcGIS Desktop. I'm getting my feet wet in GitHub and attempting to write more python scripts, particularly those using arcpy. I'd love to learn more so please comment with suggestions. In return, you are welcome to take what you need. Let me know if it helps you! Thank you in advance!
